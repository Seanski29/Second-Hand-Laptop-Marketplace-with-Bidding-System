User Registration & Login:
  Users can register an account to buy and sell laptops. Login functionality ensures that only registered users can participate in bidding.

  Sellers can list their laptops with details such as product description, starting price, and bidding deadline. Buyers can place bids on products they are interested in.

Real-time Bidding Updates:
  The bidding system updates in real-time, showing the current highest bid, allowing users to adjust their offers accordingly.

Product Images:
  Sellers can upload images of their laptops to provide a clearer view of the products they are selling.





## Usage
The purpose of this project is to create a platform that simplifies the process of buying and selling second-hand laptops. It enables people to purchase quality laptops at competitive prices through a bidding process, while also providing a secure and reliable environment for transactions.



## Suggestions
Improve User Experience:
  Future improvements can include adding a feedback system for buyers and sellers, making the bidding process more interactive, and introducing real-time chat features for better communication between buyers and sellers.

Mobile Optimization:
  The platform can be optimized for mobile devices, making it more accessible to users on the go.
